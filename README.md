### 1. ToeXhek – DSA Sorting Adventure Game

- **Description**:  
  A two-player number guessing game. Player 1 sets a secret 4-digit number. Player 2 guesses it and receives feedback based on distance. At the end, all guesses are sorted using five sorting algorithms with execution time comparison. The game includes a dark GTA-style theme, an intro screen, and persistent history storage.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  Java 17+, Swing (GUI), MySQL, JDBC, Maven, JUnit 5

- **Key Learnings**:  
  - Implementation and comparison of classic sorting algorithms  
  - GUI development using Swing and CardLayout  
  - Database integration using MySQL and JDBC  
  - Unit testing with JUnit

### 2. Simple CPU Simulator in Logisim

- **Description**:  
  A basic 8-bit CPU simulator designed in Logisim. The CPU follows a von Neumann architecture with a 4-bit address bus and shared memory for instructions and data. It simulates the full instruction cycle, including fetch, decode, execute, and memory access using a step counter and opcode-based control logic.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  Logisim

- **Key Features**:  
  - 8-bit data bus and 4-bit address bus (16 memory locations)  
  - 16 × 8-bit RAM  
  - Custom registers (IR, GR1, GR2, MAR, MBR, Output Register)  
  - ALU supporting ADD, SUB, AND, OR operations  
  - Split control unit (CU1 and CU2) using opcode and step counter  
  - 7-segment displays and LEDs for visualization  
  - Manual and simulated clock for step-by-step execution  

- **Key Learnings**:  
  - CPU datapath and control unit design  
  - Instruction fetch-execute cycle  
  - Register transfer and bus control  
  - Basic ALU and micro-sequencing concepts

### 3. Compact Assembly Toolkit – Multi-Module System-Level Project

- **Description**:  
  A modular Assembly Language toolkit designed to demonstrate core low-level programming concepts through five integrated modules. The system follows a menu-driven architecture where each module showcases a different aspect of CPU operations, memory handling, hardware interaction, and system-level programming. The project includes keyboard interrupt handling, arithmetic computation, VGA graphics rendering, a software-based CPU simulator, and a self-modifying code demonstration.

- **Technologies Used**:  
  x86 Assembly Language, BIOS Interrupts, VGA Graphics Mode, DOS Environment

- **Key Features**:  
  - Menu-driven main controller program  
  - Keyboard input handling using BIOS interrupts  
  - Smart calculator supporting arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^, %)  
  - VGA graphics mode rendering with pixel-level manipulation  
  - Software-based CPU simulator (ACC, R1, PC, instruction cycle simulation)  
  - Self-modifying code demonstration with runtime opcode modification  
  - Modular architecture using CALL and RETURN procedures  

- **Key Learnings**:  
  - Direct hardware interaction using interrupts  
  - Register-level programming and memory manipulation  
  - VGA memory addressing and video mode control  
  - Instruction cycle simulation (fetch, decode, execute)  
  - Advanced assembly concepts such as self-modifying code  
  - Structured modular design in low-level programming
